Hello everyone, 
I am a mathematics student at Utrecht University. Next to mathematics I like to code, sketch, read and more. 
Most of my repostories are projects from the Codam core. See the Codam Github page [@ Codam](https://github.com/codam-coding-college) and see the 42School Github page [@ 42School](https://github.com/42School).
Have a wonderful day!!
